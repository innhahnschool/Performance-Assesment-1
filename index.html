<h1>Juan Luna's Masterpieces</h1>
<p> Juan Luna is without doubt the most famous and celebrated Filipino artist in the history of Philippines. With iconic and remarkable masterpieces such as ‘Spolarium’, ‘Blood Compact’ and ‘The Death of Cleopatra’, Luna is known for his dynamic and unique style, along with his dramatic and captivating canvases. His work is remembered as one of the principal examples of Romanticism and Realism schools of art. Juan was not just an artist, he was a revolutionary and influential political activist who was an active participant in the Philippine Revolution that took place in the late 19th century.</p>

<h1> Spoliarium </h1>
<p class = "spolarium-text">  Spoliarium depicts bloody carcasses of slave gladiators being dragged away from the arena where they had entertained their Roman masters, with their lives. The painting was submitted by Luna to the Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1884 in Madrid, where it garnered the first gold medal. In 1886, it was sold to the Diputación Provincial de Barcelona for 20,000 pesetas. It currently hangs in the main gallery at the ground floor of the National Museum of the Philippines, and is the first work of art that greets visitors upon entry into the museum.</p>

<h1> The Parisian Life</h1>
<p> The Parisian Life, also known as Interior d'un Cafe, literally meaning "Inside a Café", is a 1892 oil on canvas painting. It portrayed a scene inside a café in Paris with a woman identified as a courtesan or a prostitute representing "fallen womanhood", who was about to rise from a sofa overshadowing three men placed at the far left corner of the painting. Apart from the prominent figure of the female wearing a pale lavender frock and a hat embellished with flowers, fronted by two glasses of beers and an empty beer mug belying a "company of men", The Parisian Life portrayed a glimpse of Luna's own life in the capital of France while accompanied by two close friends.</p>
